 <span style="font-size: 18px;">This app was developed to showcase some of the capabilities of open-source GIS tools and the national datasets produced for the research paper <i>Measuring accessibility equity in Finland with open-source GIS tools</i>. With this app, you can explore how different opportunities that most people consider necessities in their daily lives are distributed across Finland and its municipalities. You can also compare access differences between different Finnish municipalities and investigate the number of opportunities accessible by public transport or bicycle within certain time thresholds. Additionally, you have the possibility to use this tool to analyze the equity of access differences between municipalities.</span>
