 <span style="font-size: 18px;">This app was developed to showcase some of the national datasets produced for the research paper "Measuring accessibility equity in Finland with open-sourced GIS-tools". With the app, you can explore the distribution of different opportunities that one might consider important in their daily lives, compare access differences between different Finnish municipalities, and investigate the cumulative number of opportunities accessible by public transport or bicycle in different municipalities across Finland. You can also compare palma-ratios of the different municipalities in Finland and learn about the performance of the routing engine used.</span>
