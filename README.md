# Measuring equity of access in Finland with open-source GIS-tools 

This repository contains the source codes for creating the user interface for "Equity of Access in Finland" application.

This website and online tool was developed to showcase the capabilities of open-source GIS-tools and the national datasets produced for the research paper **Spatial accessibility and transport inequity in Finland: Open source models and perspectives from planning practice**. With the app you can analyze the disparity and sufficiency of accessibility in a national context and explore the distribution of different opportunities and services that most people consider necessities in their daily lives. You have also the possibility to compare access differences between Finnish municipalities and investigate the number of opportunities accessible by public transport or bicycle within certain travel time thresholds. Additionally, you have the possibility to use this tool to analyze the equity of access differences between municipalities.
